This repository stores a Google Apps Script helper (`apps_script.js`) for an Arabic electronic order form. The script writes submissions to the first sheet in the spreadsheet identified by `SHEET_ID`, creates column headers when empty, assigns a sequential order number, and tracks cumulative totals for order values and delivery fees.
